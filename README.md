## üéØ Objective

The Rust Performance Benchmark Suite tests whether optimized Rust code really improves performance. This suite helps you explore the "pitfall theory," which claims that optimization has little impact on real-world applications. 

### Hypothesis Test
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Optimized Rust techniques provide less than 20% performance improvement.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Optimized Rust techniques provide double the performance in three categories or more.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the Rust Performance Benchmark Suite easily.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- **Rust 1.70 or higher:** Download it from the official Rust website.
- **Linux system:** A system that supports performance governors.
- **Memory:** At least 16GB RAM is recommended for smooth operation.
- **sudo access:** You will need this for configuring the environment.

### Step 1: Download the Software

Visit this page to download the latest version of the Rust Performance Benchmark Suite:

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

After downloading, open your terminal and run these commands to set up the benchmark environment. This step requires administrative access (sudo):

```bash
./scripts/setup_environment.sh
```

### Step 3: Generate Test Datasets

Now, generate the test datasets that you will use for benchmarking. This may take several minutes to complete:

```bash
cargo run --bin generate_test_data
```

### Step 4: Run the Benchmarks

Once the datasets are ready, you can start running the benchmarks. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo run --bin benchmark_suite
```

This command runs the tests and provides you with the results.
